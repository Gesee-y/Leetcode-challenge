# Leetcode-challenge
All the problems I solved on leetcode. It's just so that my github won't take dust, the time for me to get a computer 

## My experience 

After some time doing leetcode I discovered that most people (especially beginners) have the same problem. Not a skill issue, but an understanding issue. They often misinterpret the exercise and get stuck for hours, then complain in the comments about how leetcode's problems are poorly written and how flawed is it.

Sometimes, once you clearly understand a problem the solution often feels natural.

## Why leetcode ?

I often feel like most people don't understand the purpose of leetcode's problems. 
As Paul Zeitz stated in "The art and crafts of problem solving" there is a difference between a
**problem** and an **exercise**.

An **exercise** is a clearly work where you just have to apply what you know, for example write the fibonacci serie algorithm. You just need to recall knowledge to solve this.

A *problem* on the other hand require you to think about how to solve the problem first. In a problem you have to understand what's stated, collect the necessary tools and relevant approaches for it.
A problem is not mean to be clear about what you have to do and how to do it, that's the role of an exercise.

Don't confuse the 2, else you will always keep complaining about how leetcode problems are poorly stated instead of thinking like a problem solver.
## How I solve my problem

- First of all, I **carefully read the exercise**. It's the most important part. I single misinterpretation can lead you on a pit. Is better to clearly restate and understand the problem before going further.

- **Listing the necessary tools**. Once the problem is understood, we need the tools to solve it. You just need to see how each part of the problem match a given pattern.

- **Using analogies**. Instead of always solving the same problem from the ground, it's often better to just search what's similar between the given problem and the problems you previously solved. This way you can just reuse their solution to go faster.

- **See the solution**: If all these strategies failed, I will just see the solution. This way I absorb the pattern for that problem and make sure that if I'm given a similar exercise again, I will be able to solve. Especially because it make a new analogy in my toolbox.

## Difficulties relativity

Peoples on Leetcode oftem misunderstand something...
Difficulty is relative.
Maybe some get discouraged after a problem took them hours but a guy just come and say "that's so easy taht it doesn't even deserve to be on leetcode".
The thing is, problems on leetcode often rely on a given pattern. There greater the exposure to such pattern, the easier the problem is.
If a problem seem hard it's just because you are discovering a new pattern, not because you are not a genius.

So it's important to follow our pace, learning and praticing patterns one at a time instead of comparing ourselves to others.
