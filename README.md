# Leetcode-challenge
All the problems I solved on leetcode. It's just so that my github won't take dust, the time for me to get a computer 

## My experience 

After some time doing leetcode I discovered that most people (especially beginners) have the same problem. Not a skill issue, but an understanding issue. They often misinterpret the exercise and get stuck for hours, then complain in the comments about how leetcode's exercises are poorly written and how flawed is it.

Sometimes, once you clearly understand a problem the solution often feels natural.

## How I solve my problem

- First of all, I **carefully read the exercise**. It's the most important part. I single misinterpretation can lead you on a pit. Is better to clearly restate and understand the problem before going further.

- **Listing the necessary tools**. Once the problem is understood, we need the tools to solve it. You just need to see how each part of the problem match a given pattern.

- **Using analogies**. Instead of always solving the same problem from the ground, it's often better to just search what's similar between the given problem and the problems you previously solved. This way you can just reuse their solution to go faster.

- **See the solution**: If all these strategies failed, I will just see the solution. This way I absorb the pattern for that problem and make sure that if I'm given a similar exercise again, I will be able to solve. Especially because it make a new analogy in my toolbox.
